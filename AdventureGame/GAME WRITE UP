### Project Overview:

This is a text-based adventure game where you play as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent trying to defend the world from a villain while the Avengers are unavailable. The game is built around exploring two main locations—Avengers Tower and a Quinjet—to find better weapons and eventually take on one of the randomly selected villains like Loki, Ultron, Thanos, or Hela.

### Key Elements and Techniques:

Key Features and Techniques:
Randomization: The game uses random.choice() to select villains and weapons, while random.uniform() creates variable success rates for certain weapons. This ensures every playthrough is unique.

Input Validation: The valid_input() function ensures players enter valid commands, keeping the game flowing smoothly without errors caused by invalid input.

Probability-Based Combat: Combat outcomes are determined by the random.random() function, with each weapon having different win probabilities. Stronger weapons like Thor’s Hammer have a higher success rate than basic weapons like the blaster.

Dynamic Weapon Discovery: The find_new_weapon() function ensures players can discover new weapons during exploration, encouraging upgrading while preventing duplicates.

Risk Management: The chance of encountering a villain increases with repeated visits to the same location, using random.random() and logic to add risk and tension as the game progresses.

Replayability: After each game, players are given the option to play again, allowing for multiple sessions without restarting the program, enhancing replay value.

By combining randomization, probability, and exploration mechanics, this game delivers a fresh and dynamic experience with each playthrough.
