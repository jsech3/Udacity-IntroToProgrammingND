### PROJECT SUMMARY ####
This project is a **Pixel Art Maker** web application that allows users to create customizable grid-based pixel art. Users can select the size of the grid (height and width) and choose a color from a color picker. They can click on individual grid cells to fill them with the selected color. The app also includes a **reset button** to clear the canvas and start over. Additionally, users can change the color of the headings by clicking on them. The project utilizes HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle interactivity and dynamic grid creation.
